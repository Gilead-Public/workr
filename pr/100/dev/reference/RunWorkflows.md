# Convenience function to run multiple workflows

**\[stable\]**

This function takes a list of workflows and a list of data as input. It
runs each workflow and returns the results as a named list where the
names of the list correspond to the workflow ID (`meta$ID`).

Workflows are run in the order they are provided in `lWorkflows`. The
results from each workflow are passed as inputs (along with `lData`) for
later workflows.

## Usage

``` r
RunWorkflows(
  lWorkflows,
  lData = NULL,
  lConfig = NULL,
  bKeepInputData = FALSE,
  bReturnResult = TRUE,
  strResultNames = c("Type", "ID"),
  bContinueOnError = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- lWorkflows:

  `list` A named list of metadata defining how the workflow should be
  run.

- lData:

  `list` A named list of domain-level data frames.

- lConfig:

  `list` Optional configuration object passed through to
  [`RunWorkflow()`](https://gilead-public.github.io/workr/dev/reference/RunWorkflow.md).
  Supported hook fields:

  - `LoadData`: Optional function or registered provider name used
    before spec validation. Functions must accept `lWorkflow`,
    `lConfig`, and `lData` as named formals. `{workr}` includes a
    built-in `"gsm.datasim"` provider that reads adapter settings from
    `lConfig$gsm.datasim`.

  - `SaveData`: Optional function or registered provider name used
    before returning results when `bReturnResult = TRUE`. Functions must
    accept `lWorkflow` and `lConfig` as named formals.

- bKeepInputData:

  `boolean` should the input data be included in `lData` after the
  workflow is run? Only relevant when bReturnResult is FALSE. Default is
  `TRUE`.

- bReturnResult:

  `boolean` should *only* the result from the last step (`lResults`) be
  returned? If false, the full workflow (including `lResults`) is
  returned. Default is `TRUE`.

- strResultNames:

  `string` vector of length two, which describes the meta fields used to
  name the output.

- bContinueOnError:

  `logical` If `TRUE`, failed workflows are recorded and later workflows
  still run. Default `FALSE` retains the existing fail-fast behavior.

## Value

A named list of results from
[`RunWorkflow()`](https://gilead-public.github.io/workr/dev/reference/RunWorkflow.md),
where the names correspond to the workflow ID. When
`bContinueOnError = TRUE`, returns a summary with `results`, `status`,
and `failures`.

## Examples

``` r
sum_step <- function(x, y) {x + y}
lWorkflows <- list(
  list(
    meta = list(Type = "demo", ID = "001"),
    steps = list(
      list(name = "sum_step", output = "result", params = list(x = "value1", y = "value2"))
    )
  )
)
lData <- list(value1 = 1, value2 = 2)
RunWorkflows(lWorkflows, lData)
